		<p><em class="dropcap">A Weber is a lot of things.</em> I’m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(crater)">a crater on the moon</a>! I’m <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit)">a unit of magnetic flux</a>! A german physicist, social scientist, and basketball player.</p>
		<p>I’m a designer raised in an era of Lisa Frank, Gecko Hawaii and Trapper Keepers and now find myself cringing at what I fear is their impending return. I have welcomed plaid back into my wardrobe with open arms and am willing to consider the re-emerging trend of neon (moderately and tastefully applied), but I draw the line at dayglow animals.</p>
		<p>As an undergraduate in <a target="”_blank”" href="”http://www.wwu.edu/design/”"> design at Western Washington University</a> in Bellingham, WA, I aimed to understand the power of messaging and branding in a political context and apply it to social and environmental issues.</p>
		<p>Through my work with sustainable building, government transparency and public arts mapping organizations, I have evolved from a print designer to a web designer working in user experience design, project management and front-end development. Most recently, I have served as creative director for the <a target="”_blank”" href="”http://sunlightfoundation.com/”">Sunlight Foundation</a>, a nonprofit that uses technology to advocate for government transparency.</p>
		<p>Right now, I am considering scale. Climate change, where global buy-in and sweeping behavioral change are necessary to make a significant impact, is dependent on scalability. How can collaboratively designed solutions to specific and localized problems act as prototypes for a healthy global future and how do those ideas and methods get translated in a way that allows them to transplant into new economies and new cultures.</p>
		<p>I’ll be considering these ideas and getting my hands dirty with social impact projects as I spend the next nine months pursuing an MA in Social Design at the MICA in Baltimore, MD.</p>
		<p><small style="display: block; border-top: 1px dashed #ffffff; padding-top: 20px;">I am currently available for small freelance projects as I pursue my <a target="_blank" href="http://micasocialdesign.com/ma">MA in Social Design at MICA</a>.</small>
