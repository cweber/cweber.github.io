    		<p>I am a UX designer, service design and creative leader that applies my experience in design thinking, product design and user research to work that I find meaningful. I've worked directly with policy writers, health data experts and senior staff in multiple federal agencies to deliver practical solutions to critical government services that were crumbling under the weight of complex regulations and decades of debt.</p>
		<p>I'm a graduate of the MICA Social Design program where we practiced design research, critical analysis of social problems and collaborative, human centered approaches to design. I spent my time in the program considering the way that design can be employed as a strategy to inform the development of interventions, rather than only as a tool to help produce a potentially ill-planned end product.</p>
