	<p><a href="http://moneypoliticstransparency.org/">Money, Politics and Transparency</a> is a collaborative Sunlight Foundation initiative that aims to generate research, analysis and global norms regarding the state of transparency in political financing systems around the world. This project required a quick turn around and buy-in from collaborators around the world. It was built to be modular and simple to update, as most of the intended content for the site has yet to be developed.
	</p>
	<p>The site was returned to about a year later once the content had been developed and we built out the display of the data section of the site. This dataset was large and highly variable, requiring flexibility in the design.
