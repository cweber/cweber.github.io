<div class="prose two-col wide">
	<p><a href="http://quienmanda.es/">Quién Manda</a> (Who’s the boss?) is a project of Civio Foundación Ciudadano, a Spanish government transparency organization. In 2013, Sunlight sent me to Madrid, Spain, to work with Civio. They were on the cusp of finishing up a major project and didn’t have the capacity to do the design work themselves. I spent my two weeks there refining their logo concept, building comps for their website and creating graphics for ads and a Goteo campaign. As I was leaving in early October, the site was ready to launch and a party, complete with Quién Manda branded cigars, was in the works.</p>
