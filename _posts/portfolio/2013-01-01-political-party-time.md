		Political Party Time, an original Sunlight Foundation data set, was established in 2008. We undertook a redesign of it in 2012. The original design was dated, but it had a certain tabloid influenced charm to it. With the goal of creating a strong structure to the data on invite pages and index pages, I maintained the influence of tabloids and newspapers while bringing in the rich colors and textures of Sunlight properties.
