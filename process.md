		<p>Designers are pattern identifiers and pattern
		makers, trained to recognize trends in existing
		designed solutions, to see parallels across ideas
		and to make unexpected, yet somehow obvious
		connections between disparate ideas. They are
		challenged to break the mold. Designers are
		mediators and translators; short time experts,
		burdened with understanding concepts broadly
		(sometimes deeply), and interpreting that expert
		understanding into a human one.</p>
		
		<p>Social designers apply these fundamentals of
		design thinking to critical human experiences; to
		influencing human and ecological systems in
		equitable and sustainable ways. Social designers
		must look at the wicked problems in the world and
		consider the constraints of existing systems,
		cultural influences, time and nature.</p>
		
		<p>To effect change, social designers must develop
		their role as a bridge between disciplines and
		begin applying new and borrowed methods to their
		human-centered toolkit. Their work must be
		flexible and solutions driven, borrowing from the
		wisdom of the past and projecting a vision for the
		future. Consult nature; sheâ€™s been at it for a while.</p>
		
		<p>Interventions should be informed by locality and
		built to evolve. The process should be open,
		inclusive, collaborative and transdisciplinary.
		Solutions should leverage existing systems and
		processes, while working to eliminate disparities
		and power imbalances within them.</p>
