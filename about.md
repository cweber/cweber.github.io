_A Weber is a lot of things._ I’m [a crater on the moon](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(crater))! I’m [a unit of magnetic flux](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weber_(unit))! A german physicist, social scientist, and basketball player.

I’m a designer raised in an era of Lisa Frank, Gecko Hawaii and Trapper Keepers and now find myself cringing at what I fear is their impending return. I have welcomed plaid back into my wardrobe with open arms and am willing to consider the re-emerging trend of neon (moderately and tastefully applied), but I draw the line at dayglow animals.

As an undergraduate in [design at Western Washington University](”http://www.wwu.edu/design/”) in Bellingham, WA, I aimed to understand the power of messaging and branding in a political context and apply it to social and environmental issues.

Through my work with sustainable building, government transparency and public arts mapping organizations, I have evolved from a print designer to a web designer working in user experience design, project management and front-end development. Most recently, I have served as creative director for the [Sunlight Foundation](”http://sunlightfoundation.com/”), a nonprofit that uses technology to advocate for government transparency.

Right now, I am considering scale. Climate change, where global buy-in and sweeping behavioral change are necessary to make a significant impact, is dependent on scalability. How can collaboratively designed solutions to specific and localized problems act as prototypes for a healthy global future and how do those ideas and methods get translated in a way that allows them to transplant into new economies and new cultures.

I’ll be considering these ideas and getting my hands dirty with social impact projects as I spend the next nine months pursuing an MA in Social Design at the MICA in Baltimore, MD.
